Book: THE FIFTH BOOK
Quote: XIII
Text: All that I consist of, is either form or matter. No corruption can reduce either of these unto nothing: for neither did I of nothing become a subsistent creature. Every part of mine then will by mutation be disposed into a certain part of the whole world, and that in time into another part; and so _in infinitum;_ by which kind of mutation, I also became what I am, and so did they that begot me, and they before them, and so upwards _in infinitum_. For so we may be allowed to speak, though the age and government of the world, be to some certain periods of time limited, and confined.
